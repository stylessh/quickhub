# DiffKit Extension

Standalone browser extension for redirecting only selected GitHub URLs to DiffKit.

## What it does

- Redirects matching GitHub URLs at page start
- Lets you keep the extension globally enabled or disabled
- Shows one toggle per redirect rule in the popup
- Uses a configurable list of rules instead of redirecting every GitHub page
- Supports both exact URL redirects and regex-based route schemas
- Supports custom route remaps like GitHub PR changes pages to DiffKit review pages

## Default rule

The extension ships with these enabled rules:

- `https://github.com/`
- `https://diff-kit.com/`
- `https://github.com/pulls/*`
- `https://diff-kit.com/pulls`
- `https://github.com/issues/*`
- `https://diff-kit.com/issues`
- `https://github.com/:owner/:repo/pull/:number`
- `https://diff-kit.com/:owner/:repo/pull/:number`
- `https://github.com/:owner/:repo/pull/:number/changes`
- `https://diff-kit.com/:owner/:repo/review/:number`
- `https://github.com/:owner/:repo/issues/:number`
- `https://diff-kit.com/:owner/:repo/issues/:number`

## Rule format

```json
[
  {
    "id": "github-pull-details",
    "label": "Pull request details",
    "description": "Redirect GitHub pull request detail pages to DiffKit.",
    "enabled": true,
    "match": {
      "urlRegex": "^https://github\\.com/([^/?#]+)/([^/?#]+)/pull/(\\d+)/?$",
      "excludeUrlRegexes": []
    },
    "redirect": {
      "replacement": "https://diff-kit.com/$1/$2/pull/$3"
    }
  }
]
```

For an exact URL redirect, use:

```json
{
    "id": "one-off",
    "label": "Specific PR page",
    "description": "Single URL redirect",
    "enabled": true,
    "match": {
      "exactUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"
  },
  "redirect": {
    "url": "https://diff-kit.com/org/repo/pull/123"
  }
}
```

## Install locally

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click Load unpacked
4. Select `extensions/diffkit-redirect`

## Scope

This version is intentionally limited to `github.com` in `manifest.json`. If you later want redirects from other source hosts, add those hosts to the extension matches and permissions.

## Popup behavior

The popup keeps all default rules enabled unless you turn specific ones off. Use the master switch to pause all redirects without losing your per-rule selections.
