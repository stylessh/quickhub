# Contributing to DiffKit

Thanks for your interest in contributing to DiffKit! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

Follow the [Getting Started](README.md#getting-started) section in the README to set up your local environment. You'll need both a GitHub OAuth App and a GitHub App configured.

## Project Architecture

DiffKit is a **pnpm monorepo** managed with **Turborepo**:

```
diffkit/
├── apps/
│   └── dashboard/          # Main web app (TanStack Start + Cloudflare Workers)
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── components/ # App-specific React components
│       │   ├── db/         # Drizzle ORM schema and database access
│       │   ├── lib/        # Auth, GitHub API clients, caching, utilities
│       │   └── routes/     # File-based routes (TanStack Router)
│       │       ├── api/    # API routes (auth callbacks, webhooks)
│       │       └── _protected/ # Auth-gated routes
│       └── drizzle/        # SQL migration files
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                 # Shared UI components (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
│   ├── icons/              # Icon wrapper package

└── scripts/                # Migration runner and dev utilities
```

### Key Technologies

- **TanStack Router** — File-based routing in `apps/dashboard/src/routes/`
- **TanStack Query** — Server state management and caching
- **Drizzle ORM** — Database schema and migrations in `apps/dashboard/src/db/` and `apps/dashboard/drizzle/`
- **Better Auth** — Authentication with a GitHub OAuth App, plus GitHub App user and installation tokens for installed repos
- **Cloudflare D1** — SQLite database at the edge

### GitHub Integration

DiffKit uses a hybrid GitHub auth model:

- The **GitHub OAuth App** signs users in and powers broad user-context reads, including public or external repositories where the GitHub App is not installed.
- The **GitHub App user token** (`ghu_` prefix) powers installation discovery via `GET /user/installations`.
- The **GitHub App installation token** is preferred for repo-scoped reads and writes when the app is installed for that owner.

Auth callbacks:
- OAuth App: `/api/auth/callback/github`
- GitHub App user authorization: `/api/github/app/callback`
- GitHub App setup URL: `/?show-org-setup=true` (with **Redirect on update** enabled)

Environment variables are documented in `apps/dashboard/.dev.vars.example`. Do not commit real `.dev.vars` values or private keys. If a private key is exposed, revoke it in GitHub App settings and generate a replacement.

### Adding a New Route

Routes live in `apps/dashboard/src/routes/`. TanStack Router uses file-based routing — create a new file and the route is automatically registered.

Protected routes go under `_protected/` which enforces authentication.

### Adding a UI Component

Shared components go in `packages/ui/src/components/`. App-specific components go in `apps/dashboard/src/components/`.

## Workflow

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** — keep commits focused and atomic
3. **Run checks** before pushing:
   ```bash
   pnpm check-types   # Type checking
   pnpm lint           # Linting
   pnpm format         # Formatting
   ```
4. **Open a pull request** against `main`

## Code Style

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Run `pnpm format` to auto-format your code. Pre-commit hooks via Husky and lint-staged will also catch issues before they're committed.

A few conventions:

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Keep components in the appropriate package (`apps/dashboard` for app-specific, `packages/ui` for shared)
- Use `cn()` for composing class names (not template literals)
- Use `flex` + `gap` for spacing (not `space-x` / `space-y`)

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Write a clear title and description explaining what changed and why
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Make sure all checks pass before requesting review

## Reporting Bugs
