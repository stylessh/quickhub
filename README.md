# DiffKit

A fast, design-first GitHub dashboard for developers who want to stay on top of their pull requests, issues, and code reviews — without the noise.

> [!WARNING]
> **Alpha** — DiffKit is in early release. Expect bugs, errors, and rough edges. Feedback and issue reports are welcome on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/stylessh/diffkit/issues).

## Features

- **Pull Requests** — View, filter, and manage your open PRs across repos
- **Issues** — Track assigned issues with labels, milestones, and status
- **Code Reviews** — See pending review requests in one place
- **PR Diff Viewer** — Review pull request changes with inline comments
- **Dark Mode** — Full dark mode support out of the box
- **Fast** — Deployed on Cloudflare Workers at the edge

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v10+

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stylessh/diffkit.git
cd diffkit
pnpm install
```

### 2. Create a GitHub OAuth App

The OAuth App handles user login and broad-scope reads (`repo`, `read:org`, `user:email`). It's also the fallback for repositories where the GitHub App is not installed.

1. Go to [GitHub OAuth App settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click **New OAuth App**
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Application name**: DiffKit (local)
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
3. Click **Register application**
4. Copy the **Client ID**
5. Click **Generate a new client secret** and copy it

You'll need both values for your `.dev.vars` file in step 5.

### 3. Create a GitHub App

The GitHub App provides installation tokens for repo-scoped access, webhook delivery, and user-to-server tokens for installation discovery.

1. Go to [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) and click **New GitHub App**
2. Fill in the form:
   - **GitHub App name**: DiffKit Dev (must be globally unique)
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/github/app/callback`
   - **Setup URL**: `http://localhost:3000/setup`
   - Check **Redirect on update**
   - Leave **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** **unchecked**
   - **Webhook URL**: leave blank for now (see [Local webhook testing](#local-webhook-testing) below)

3. Under **Permissions**, grant the following:

   | Category | Permission | Level |
   |----------|-----------|-------|
   | Repository | Metadata | Read-only |
   | Repository | Pull requests | Read & write |
   | Repository | Issues | Read & write |
   | Repository | Checks | Read-only |
   | Repository | Actions | Read-only |
   | Repository | Contents | Read & write |
   | Organization | Members | Read-only |
   | Account | Email addresses | Read-only |

4. Under **Subscribe to events**, enable:
   - Check run
   - Check suite
   - Issue comment
   - Issues
   - Pull request
   - Pull request review
   - Pull request review comment
   - Pull request review thread
   - Status
   - Repository ruleset
   - Branch protection rule
   - Workflow run

5. Click **Create GitHub App**

6. On the app settings page, note down:
   - **App ID** (numeric, shown at the top)
   - **Client ID** (starts with `Iv1.`)
   - The **slug** from the app URL (`https://github.com/apps/<slug>`)

7. Generate credentials:
   - Click **Generate a new client secret** and copy it
   - Under **Private keys**, click **Generate a private key** — a `.pem` file will download

8. Convert the private key to a single-line format for `.dev.vars`:
   ```bash
   awk 'NF {printf "%s\\n", $0}' /path/to/downloaded-key.pem
   ```
   GitHub downloads PKCS#1 keys (`BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`). DiffKit auto-converts to PKCS#8 at runtime.

### 4. Install the GitHub App

1. Go to your GitHub App's settings page → **Install App**
2. Choose the user or organization you want DiffKit to access
3. Select **All repositories** or pick specific ones
4. Click **Install**

### 5. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in the values from steps 2–4:

```bash
cp apps/dashboard/.dev.vars.example apps/dashboard/.dev.vars
```

Open `apps/dashboard/.dev.vars` and fill in:

```
# From the OAuth App (step 2)
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret

# From the GitHub App (step 3)
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.your_app_client_id
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_client_secret
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GITHUB_APP_SLUG=your-app-slug

# Webhook secret (set the same value in your GitHub App settings)
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_at_least_32_chars
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

> DiffKit also accepts the legacy `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` names as a fallback for the OAuth App credentials.

### 6. Run database migrations

```bash
pnpm --filter dashboard migrate
```

### 7. Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Local webhook testing

To receive GitHub webhooks locally, you need a public tunnel:

1. Start a tunnel (e.g. with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)):
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
2. Copy the public URL (e.g. `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)
3. Add it to `apps/dashboard/.dev.vars`:
   ```
   DEV_TUNNEL_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
   ```
4. In your GitHub App settings, set **Webhook URL** to:
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/github
   ```
5. Generate a **Webhook secret** and set the same value in both GitHub and your `.dev.vars`
6. Restart the dev server

The dev server uses `DEV_TUNNEL_URL` to allow the tunnel host and configure HMR correctly.

## GitHub App Permissions Reference

Expanding permissions after users have installed the app will require those installations to approve the new permission set.
